# DestinationEats | 67328 Mobile to Cloud

Final project for 67328:

Developed for Mobile to Cloud, DestinationEats is a web application that allows users to find restaurants based on their travel destination and create smart itinerary lists. Users must first register an account -- a simple, painless process -- to begin using the web app. They can then search for restaurants based on cities and view the top 20 best matched restaurants pulled from the Yelp API (https://www.yelp.co.uk/developers). The restaurants they choose to add or delete are saved and accessed through the mongo database hosted on mLab and these CRUD functionalities are handled within the MVC structure of the app. While the application name and logo were an original creation, part of the logo image used a location icon created by Freepik from www.flaticon.com.

The website is hosted using Now. For a live demo, click here: https://destinationeats-qbqduyhsxu.now.sh/home
